The Nervous System Gallery ia an interactive React-based educational gallery desined to help visualize and study neurological images using cientific images from Wikimedia Commons. This project focuses on clarity, accessibility, and clean data handling, transforming a complex external API into a structured, user-friendly learning tool.
Images are fetched dynamically using the Wikimedia Commons API with selective parameters to request only the necessary data.Instead of rendering the raw API response, the data is normalized into a clean structure.

This project demonstrates:

    - Fetching and handling complex external APIs
    - Using URL parameters to control API responses
    - Normalizing data before storing it in state
    - Managing side effects with useEffect
    - Building accessible UI components
    - Debugging real-world React and CSS issues
